# Set up a namespace

Set up a Kubernetes namespace on KubeSail.

On the [KubeSail homepage](https://kubesail.com/), click **Start for Free**. You will see an OAuth prompt to allow KubeSail access to your GitHub account. Confirm KubeSail as an authorized OAuth app by clicking **Authorize kubesail**.

You will be redirected back to KubeSail. Now when you navigate to **Namespace**, you can review details about your free, managed namespace.
